# HollowClock4
 
Hollow clock 4 c++ port of the python code for the Pico based https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5808550 project

This code is GPIO pin compatible with the original python code, but this code runs as single steps, the python code runs in blocks of 32 steps which means its easier to see the hands moving with the python code.
